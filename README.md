# Multiplayer-Pictionary-Socket

This is a multiplayer pictionary game with a chatbox that uses node.js for server capability. The difference is that the user gets to input their own word, and as long as the guess contains the word - say "fire" but the guesser guesses "bonfire" - the word is considered guessed.
